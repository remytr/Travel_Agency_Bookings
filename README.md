# Travel_Agency_Bookings
Case study on a travel agency experiencing huge growth in mobile bookings.

## Objective
Over the past few years, epictrips.com has seen huge growth in the number of mobile bookings made. To utilise this, epictrips.com needs to understand how customers are using mobile devices to:
- Tailor the mobile app and mobile website,
- Ensure the best selection of hotels available,
- Target marketing efforts appropriately.

## The Dataset
Two datasets. Includes the booking window group (how far in advance bookings were made), net gross booking order USD, and net orders, by destination, country of origin, region, and platform type (desktop, mobile app, mobile web). Other dataset included the number of visits to epictrips.com by week, country, platform type, and region.

## Conclusion & Outcome
Produced a dashboard and case study. 

Americans are booking the most trips out of any country and are primarily travelling within the US. Recommendation: Advertise more hotels in the US and target marketing efforts towards the US.
The mobile app is outperforming the mobile web. Recommendation: Continually make UI/UX improvements.
Travellers book holidays last minute. Recommendation: Offer pricing and discount strategies to utilise the large number of people making last-minute bookings.
